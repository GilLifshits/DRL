# Deep Reinforcement Learning: Q-LEARNING AND DQN
Implementing Q-LEARNING AND DQN Algorithms in an OpenAI Gym Environment

Training a model that aims to maintain the stability of a pendulum that is influenced by the basic laws of physics.
This model was implemented using a neural network that received as input the current state characteristics of the pendulum (position,
velocity, angle, angular velocity), and returned as output the action that should be performed to maintain its stability (right, left).

Implementations:
 - tabular Q-learning model on a simple environment.
 - Neural Network function approximator of the Q-value, using the basic DQN algorithm.
